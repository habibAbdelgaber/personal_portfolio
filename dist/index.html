                    Hi, my name is Habib. Here I would like to talk about web development and web designing when I
                    started
                    to.
                    In 2018 I began to code online on youtube, but it was quite defficult to me to code, even
                    though
                    I tried many times to do so.
                    However, I didn't give up, I continued coding online but then I decided to go somewhere where
                    I
                    can
                    attend
                    some programming classes and learn quickly.
                    I began with Java programming langauge but it was also quite defficult to continue, and
                    the
                    tutor I
                    went to him was't qualified well, too. I asked myself Why
                    don't I start with the easy programming langauge?
                    I opened the chrome browser and made a search which programming to start with as a beginner ? and I
                    have found that most developers recommand
                    to
                    who
                    wants to start in web development,
                    is better to start with Python. I wrote down that note &rdquo; Python &ldquo;. One upon the time, I
                    saw an ad on
                    my Facebook says &rdquo;<strong><i>Learn Python for absolute beginners and become Full Stack web
                            developer</i></strong>&ldquo;. Forturnately, I found one
                    called
                    INT-College which
                    it was
                    nearby my work place, I went there and i have learned my first programming langauge
                    <a href="#"><em>Pyhon</em></a> for FullSstack web developement about 10 months, also I learned all
                    fundamentals
                    of <a href="#"><em>,
                            Css,
                            Javascript,
                            Git, GitHub, Django and MySql database</em></a>, it was really a great opportunity I have
                    had
                    there.
                    I still
                    love
                    coding
                    a lot until today:)

                    Still coding not yet started any work at any company though I can.
                    My hobby to become a programer was not only to work at the company but to teach others those are
                    looking
                    for to code as well as me.
                    Recently I started teaching some of my friends Python programming and coding in general.

                        Computer coding is the use of computer programming languages to give computers and machines
                        instructions on what actions to perform. Coding is the way humans communicate with machines, and
                        it allows us to create software like programs, operating systems, and mobile apps

                    <p class="about__4--2--p">
                        Coding is the process of translating and writing codes from one language to another whereas
                        Programming is the process of building an executable program that can be used to carry out
                        proper
                        machine level outputs. Coding only deals with the codes and so it is less intimidating and less
                        intensive.

                    <p class="about__4--2--p">
                        You can be bad at arithmetic and calculus and still be a great programmer. However it's unlikely
                        you can be bad at logic and structured proofs while still being a great programmer. Rigorous
                        abstract logic as used in high level mathematics is integral to programming.

                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to
                        be

                        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                        and
                        originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                        colors,
                        and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and

                        share
